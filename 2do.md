git this at some point rather soon

dumping the rates of the entire recording
- requires rate estimation parameters
- is this ever needed?

dumping the sliced rates around the stim times
- requires either the recodgin and the parameters
- or the sliced rates and the times
- latter makes more sense, as this is a two step process
- estimate rate, and slice 
- slice takes times

~ stimulus efficiency
computing pre and post times
getting sig mod
everything that is single metric
Q: does stim history influence next response?
